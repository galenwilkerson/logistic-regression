# Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression using Python. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).

## Introduction

Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, medical fields, social sciences, and more. This repository provides an example of how to implement logistic regression in Python, using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is included within the notebook itself. It can be easily modified to work with different datasets by changing the data loading and preprocessing steps.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/logistic-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd logistic-regression
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Logistic Regression.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the implementation and results.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand its structure and relationships.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing logistic regression using `scikit-learn`.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of the findings and potential improvements.
